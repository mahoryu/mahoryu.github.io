For my first project I wanted to illustrate that most people fall somewhere in the middle of the introvert/extrovert spectrum instead of being placed at either extreme end of the spectrum.  
I was able to do this with a data set from an online survey that asked a series of 91 questions about how much they agreed with a statement from 1-5 and then asked them to self-identify as introverted, extroverted or neither. From this I was able to find the mean answer for each of these questions base on what they answered for their personality type.
